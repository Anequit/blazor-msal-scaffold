This repository contains basic scaffolding of a Blazor WASM and MAUI Blazor Hybrid using MSAL (Microsoft Authentication Library) login via Entra/Azure for a single tenant.

Each commit will be a step in the process.

1. Blazor WASM with MSAL login
2. MAUI Blazor Hybrid with MSAL login
3. Reading app roles from Entra/Azure and attaching them to a custom user object that can be used throughout the app. Will demonstrate the following roles: `["Weather.View", "Counter.View", "Counter.Click"]`
